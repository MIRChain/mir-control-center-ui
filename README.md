### Quick Start

Clone, install dependencies, and start the application:

```
git clone https://github.com/MIRChain/mir-grid-ui.git
cd grid-ui
yarn && yarn start
```

This will serve the application at `localhost:3080`, but little can be done without the [Grid](https://github.com/ethereum/grid) electron wrapper:

```
git clone https://github.com/MIRChain/mir-grid.git
cd grid
yarn && yarn start:dev
```
